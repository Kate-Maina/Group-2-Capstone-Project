    "In the highly competitive retail landscape, accurate demand planning plays a critical role in driving profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and supporting sustainable growth for businesses. As such, demand forecasting is a fundamental element of a successful retail strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Industry Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers are constantly challenged to manage the balance between two key risks—overstocking and understocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overstocking** results in tied-up working capital, elevated storage expenses, and an increased likelihood of product obsolescence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understocking** can lead to missed sales opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and a potential decline in market share.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Date: Transaction date (e.g., 01/02/2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Transaction Type: Almost all are \"Sales Receipt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "+ No.: Receipt number is the transaction ID e.g. KEBTTVM84156\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Product/Service: Name of the product sold (e.g., \"S/N3, LADIES T-SHIRT S/S\")\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Memo/Description: Additional description (often repeats the product name)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Quantity: Quantity sold\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Sales Price: Price per unit (formatted with commas as thousand separators)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Amount: Total amount for the line item (Qty × Sales Price)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Balance: Cumulative balance (running total of sales)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Year: 2022 - 2024 for all entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ SourceFile: Indicates the source CSV file i.e. Thrift Company_Sales_All.csv \n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "+ Customer: All sales are under different stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Products: Wide variety of second-hand or thrift items:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Clothing (e.g., jackets, pants, shirts, dresses)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Accessories (e.g., wool caps, scarves, boots)\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Home textiles (e.g., curtains, bedsheets, towels)\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Bulk items (e.g., \"Wholesale Bales\", \"Nylon Rummage\")\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Pricing: Prices are in Kenyan Shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Volume: Many transactions involve large quantities (e.g. 90 units of \"Hooded Polo\" sold at once).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Cumulative Balance: The Balance column shows a running total by the end of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this data to:\n",

    "+ Analyze sales trends by product category, month, or season.\n",

    "+ Calculate total revenue per product, customer, or time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Track inventory movement based on quantity sold.\n",

    "### Risks and Limitations\n",
    "+ Some product names are inconsistent (e.g., mixed case, typos, abbreviations).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The Sales Price and Amount columns are stored as text with commas, we will convert them to numbers for analysis.\n",
