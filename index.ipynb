    "#### Domain Knowledge – Retail Demand Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the highly competitive retail landscape, accurate demand planning plays a critical role in driving profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and supporting sustainable growth for businesses. As such, demand forecasting is a fundamental element of a successful retail strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Industry Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers are constantly challenged to manage the balance between two key risks—overstocking and understocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overstocking** results in tied-up working capital, elevated storage expenses, and an increased likelihood of product obsolescence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understocking** can lead to missed sales opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and a potential decline in market share.\n",
