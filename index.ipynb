    "## 1. Business Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "Thrift store chains in Kenya struggle with significant operational inefficiencies and lost profitability due to the reliance on manual, reactive judgment for inventory decisions. This approach fails to account for the market's high volatility, leading to frequent stockouts of high-demand items and excessive accumulation of slow-moving stock. The core business problem is the **absence of a data-driven demand forecasting system** to predict customer demand accurately, resulting in increased holding costs, missed sales opportunities, reduced customer satisfaction, and poor resource allocation across branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenyan thrift retail industry operates in a uniquely challenging and fast-moving environment characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Irregular Supply Chains:** Inconsistent and unpredictable donations/purchases of second-hand goods lead to fluctuating and non-uniform product assortments.\n",
    "*   **Volatile Consumer Demand:** Demand is heavily influenced by price sensitivity, seasonal patterns, fluctuating disposable incomes, and rapidly shifting fashion trends.\n",
    "*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Despite possessing large volumes of historical sales data, retailers lack the analytical framework to transform this data into actionable insights. Decisions on restocking, procurement, and inter-store transfers are based on experience and guesswork rather than predictive intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of factors creates a cycle of reactive decision-making. The absence of systematic forecasting directly contributes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Frequent stockouts** of fast-moving items, leading to lost sales and dissatisfied customers.\n",
    "*   **Overstocking** of slow-moving products, increasing holding costs and capital tied up in stagnant inventory.\n",
    "*   **Suboptimal allocation** of inventory across branches, preventing the strategic placement of products where they are most likely to sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Project Vision and Value Proposition\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address this critical gap by developing a robust, data-driven demand forecasting framework. By leveraging historical sales data to build predictive models that capture seasonality, product-level trends, and store-specific variations, this project will provide thrift stores with the tools to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Accurately anticipate** what customers will buy and in what quantity.\n",
    "*   **Stock the right products** at the right time and in the right branches.\n",
    "*   **Transition from reactive** to **proactive and evidence-based** inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate value is enhanced inventory planning, reduced waste, improved sales performance, strengthened competitiveness, and increased profitability in Kenya's dynamic thrift retail sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Research Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this vision, the project has the following specific objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **To analyze** historical sales data to identify key demand patterns, seasonality, and product performance trends across the thrift store chain.\n",
    "2.  **To develop and compare** multiple demand forecasting models (including statistical, machine learning, and time-series approaches) for predicting demand at various aggregation levels (product, category, and store).\n",
    "3.  **To evaluate** the forecasting accuracy of these models using established error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, sMAPE) and assess their suitability for dealing with both intermittent and fast-moving demand patterns common in thrift retail.\n",
    "4.  **To design** an integrated demand forecasting framework that directly supports inventory optimization by minimizing stockouts, reducing overstocking, and improving cross-branch allocation.\n",
    "5.  **To generate** actionable insights and strategic recommendations to inform procurement, pricing, and distribution decisions for thrift store chain managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Key  Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be guided by the following  questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What specific demand patterns, seasonal effects, and product life-cycle trends can be identified from the historical sales data of the thrift store chain?\n",
    "2.  Which factors (e.g., product category, seasonality, pricing, store location) most significantly influence customer demand in the Kenyan thrift market?\n",
    "3.  Which forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Croston, Prophet, Random Forest, XGBoost) provide the most accurate and reliable predictions for thrift store demand, especially given its intermittent nature?\n",
    "4.  How can the implementation of accurate demand forecasting directly improve inventory planning metrics by reducing incidences of stockouts and overstocking?\n",
    "5.  What is a recommended practical and scalable forecasting framework to support both strategic and operational decision-making for thrift store chains in Kenya?"

    "    4.Bulk items (e.g., \"Wholesale Bales\", \"Nylon Rummage\")\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Pricing: Prices are in Kenyan Shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Volume: Many transactions involve large quantities (e.g. 90 units of \"Hooded Polo\" sold at once).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Cumulative Balance: The Balance column shows a running total by the end of the sample.\n",

    "| Inconsistent Product Descriptions | Product names appear in different formats (e.g., *“Jogging pants”* vs *“S/N3, JOGGING PANTS”*), sometimes with wholesale prefixes, making grouping unreliable. | Standardize product descriptions by cleaning text (lowercasing, trimming spaces, removing prefixes) and clustering into broader product categories (e.g., *Jeans*, *Shirts*, *Jackets*). |\n",
    "| Missing or Blank Values | The `Memo/Description` field contains blanks or missing values, and some wholesale lines lack detail. | Replace blanks with a placeholder (e.g., *“Unknown”*) to retain transaction counts, or drop rows where critical fields (Date, Qty, Amount) are missing. |\n",
    "| Transaction-Level Granularity | The dataset is highly granular (one line per product per receipt). Forecasting on raw rows is inefficient and noisy. | Aggregate data to **daily totals per Shop × Product Category**, reducing noise and aligning with forecasting requirements. |\n",
    "| Lack of Product Hierarchy | No structured hierarchy (Category → Sub-category → SKU), making it difficult to analyze patterns across similar items. | Create a manual or rule-based mapping that groups items into 10–15 categories. Forecast demand at the category level. |\n",
    "| Volatility in Second-Hand Clothing Sales | Sales depend heavily on bale arrivals (supply-driven) rather than pure customer demand, introducing randomness. | Model demand at higher aggregation (e.g., monthly or category totals) to smooth volatility, and clearly document this limitation. |\n",
    "| Intermittent and Sparse Demand | Some products show long periods of zero sales followed by sudden spikes. Classical models (like ARIMA) struggle with this. | Apply forecasting techniques suited for intermittent demand (e.g., Croston’s method, Prophet, or gradient boosting regressors) or aggregate categories to reduce sparsity. |\n",
    "| Cold-Start Products | New product types appear in later years with no prior history, making forecasting difficult. | Use category-level patterns to estimate demand for new items and apply conservative forecasting until enough history is available. |\n",
    "| External Factors Not Captured | Dataset does not include promotions, holidays, or weather, which are known demand drivers. | Document this limitation and, if possible, enrich the dataset with external features (e.g., calendar events, macroeconomic indicators). |\n"
